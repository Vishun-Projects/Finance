# Debug Logs Added to Frontend

## Changes Made

Added comprehensive debug logging to `IncomeManagement.tsx` to track the transaction parsing and display flow.

## Debug Logging Points

### 1. Parse Response Handling (Lines 296-357)
- ✅ Logs when fetch starts
- ✅ Logs response status
- ✅ Logs received data structure
- ✅ Logs transaction count and first 3 transactions
- ✅ Logs when state is set
- ✅ Logs when preview dialog opens

### 2. State Tracking (Lines 135-142)
- ✅ New useEffect that logs state changes
- ✅ Tracks showCsvPreview changes
- ✅ Tracks parsedTransactions changes
- ✅ Shows first 3 transactions on each change

### 3. Filtering Logic (Lines 81-119)
- ✅ Logs total transactions before filtering
- ✅ Logs filter mode (previewMonthOnly)
- ✅ Logs date range for filtering
- ✅ Logs filtered result count
- ✅ Logs which transactions are filtered out

### 4. Critical Fix Applied (Line 75)
- ✅ Changed `previewMonthOnly` default from `true` to `false`
- ✅ **This is the fix!** Previously October transactions were being filtered out in January

## What to Look For in Console

When you upload a file, you should see:

```
🔍 FRONTEND: Starting parse-pdf fetch...
🔍 FRONTEND: Response status: true
🔍 FRONTEND: Received data: {...}
🔍 FRONTEND: Setting parsedTransactions: 20 items
🔍 FRONTEND: First 3 transactions: [...]
🔍 STATE CHANGE: showCsvPreview = true
🔍 STATE CHANGE: parsedTransactions.length = 20
🔍 FILTERING: parsedTransactions.length: 20
🔍 FILTERING: previewMonthOnly: false
✅ FILTERING: Returning ALL transactions
✅ FILTERING: Filtered result: 20 transactions
```

## Expected Behavior Now

1. Upload PDF with October transactions
2. See all 20 transactions (not filtered)
3. Both "Raw Transaction Data" and "Processed Data" show content
4. Can import to database

## If Still Empty

Check console logs to identify where the data is lost:
- If no transactions logged after parsing → Parse API issue
- If transactions logged but filtered = 0 → Date filtering issue
- If preview not showing → Dialog/DOM issue
- If preview shows but table empty → Rendering issue
